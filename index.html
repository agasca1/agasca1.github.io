	THE LEROUGE CASE

	By Emile Gaboriau




	CHAPTER I.

	On Thursday, the 6th of March, 1862, two days after Shrove Tuesday, five
	women belonging to the village of La Jonchere presented themselves at
	the police station at Bougival.

	They stated that for two days past no one had seen the Widow Lerouge,
	one of their neighbours, who lived by herself in an isolated cottage.
	They had several times knocked at the door, but all in vain. The
	window-shutters as well as the door were closed; and it was impossible
	to obtain even a glimpse of the interior.

	This silence, this sudden disappearance alarmed them. Apprehensive of
	a crime, or at least of an accident, they requested the interference of
	the police to satisfy their doubts by forcing the door and entering the
	house.

	Bougival is a pleasant riverside village, peopled on Sundays by crowds
	of boating parties. Trifling offences are frequently heard of in its
	neighbourhood, but crimes are rare.

	The commissary of police at first refused to listen to the women, but
	their importunities so fatigued him that he at length acceded to their
	request. He sent for the corporal of gendarmes, with two of his
	men, called into requisition the services of a locksmith, and, thus
	accompanied, followed the neighbours of the Widow Lerouge.

	La Jonchere owes some celebrity to the inventor of the sliding railway,
	who for some years past has, with more enterprise than profit, made
	public trials of his system in the immediate neighbourhood. It is
	a hamlet of no importance, resting upon the slope of the hill which
	overlooks the Seine between La Malmaison and Bougival. It is about
	twenty minutes’ walk from the main road, which, passing by Rueil and
	Port-Marly, goes from Paris to St. Germain, and is reached by a steep
	and rugged lane, quite unknown to the government engineers.

	The party, led by the gendarmes, followed the main road which here
	bordered the river until it reached this lane, into which it turned, and
	stumbled over the rugged inequalities of the ground for about a hundred
	yards, when it arrived in front of a cottage of extremely modest yet
	respectable appearance. This cottage had probably been built by some
	little Parisian shopkeeper in love with the beauties of nature; for
	all the trees had been carefully cut down. It consisted merely of two
	apartments on the ground floor with a loft above. Around it extended a
	much-neglected garden, badly protected against midnight prowlers, by
	a very dilapidated stone wall about three feet high, and broken and
	crumbling in many places. A light wooden gate, clumsily held in its
	place by pieces of wire, gave access to the garden.

	“It is here,” said the women.

	The commissary stopped. During his short walk, the number of his
	followers had been rapidly increasing, and now included all the
	inquisitive and idle persons of the neighbourhood. He found himself
	surrounded by about forty individuals burning with curiosity.

	“No one must enter the garden,” said he; and, to ensure obedience, he
	placed the two gendarmes on sentry before the entrance, and advanced
	towards the house, accompanied by the corporal and the locksmith.

	He knocked several times loudly with his leaded cane, first at the door,
	and then successively at all the window shutters. After each blow, he
	placed his ear against the wood and listened. Hearing nothing, he turned
	to the locksmith.

	“Open!” said he.

	The workman unstrapped his satchel, and produced his implements. He had
	already introduced a skeleton key into the lock, when a loud exclamation
	was heard from the crowd outside the gate.

	“The key!” they cried. “Here is the key!”

	A boy about twelve years old playing with one of his companions, had
	seen an enormous key in a ditch by the roadside; he had picked it up and
	carried it to the cottage in triumph.

	“Give it to me youngster,” said the corporal. “We shall see.”

	The key was tried, and it proved to be the key of the house.

	The commissary and the locksmith exchanged glances full of sinister
	misgivings. “This looks bad,” muttered the corporal. They entered the
	house, while the crowd, restrained with difficulty by the gendarmes,
	stamped with impatience, or leant over the garden wall, stretching their
	necks eagerly, to see or hear something of what was passing within the
	cottage.

	Those who anticipated the discovery of a crime, were unhappily not
	deceived. The commissary was convinced of this as soon as he crossed the
	threshold. Everything in the first room pointed with a sad eloquence to
	the recent presence of a malefactor. The furniture was knocked about,
	and a chest of drawers and two large trunks had been forced and broken
	open.

	In the inner room, which served as a sleeping apartment, the disorder
	was even greater. It seemed as though some furious hand had taken a
	fiendish pleasure in upsetting everything. Near the fireplace, her face
	buried in the ashes, lay the dead body of Widow Lerouge. All one side of
	the face and the hair were burnt; it seemed a miracle that the fire had
	not caught her clothing.

	“Wretches!” exclaimed the corporal. “Could they not have robbed, without
	assassinating the poor woman?”

	“But where has she been wounded?” inquired the commissary, “I do not see
	any blood.”

	“Look! here between the shoulders,” replied the corporal; “two fierce
	blows, by my faith. I’ll wager my stripes she had no time to cry out.”

	He stooped over the corpse and touched it.

	“She is quite cold,” he continued, “and it seems to me that she is no
	longer very stiff. It is at least thirty-six hours since she received
	her death-blow.”

	The commissary began writing, on the corner of a table, a short official
	report.

	“We are not here to talk, but to discover the guilty,” said he to the
	corporal. “Let information be at once conveyed to the justice of the
	peace, and the mayor, and send this letter without delay to the Palais
	de Justice. In a couple of hours, an investigating magistrate can be
	here. In the meanwhile, I will proceed to make a preliminary inquiry.”

	“Shall I carry the letter?” asked the corporal of gendarmes.

	“No, send one of your men; you will be useful to me here in keeping
	these people in order, and in finding any witnesses I may want. We
	must leave everything here as it is. I will install myself in the other
	room.”

	A gendarme departed at a run towards the station at Rueil; and the
	commissary commenced his investigations in regular form, as prescribed
	by law.

	“Who was Widow Lerouge? Where did she come from? What did she do? Upon
	what means, and how did she live? What were her habits, her morals, and
	what sort of company did she keep? Was she known to have enemies? Was
	she a miser? Did she pass for being rich?”

	The commissary knew the importance of ascertaining all this: but
	although the witnesses were numerous enough, they possessed but
	little information. The depositions of the neighbours, successively
	interrogated, were empty, incoherent, and incomplete. No one knew
	anything of the victim, who was a stranger in the country. Many
	presented themselves as witnesses moreover, who came forward less to
	afford information than to gratify their curiosity. A gardener’s wife,
	who had been friendly with the deceased, and a milk-woman with whom
	she dealt, were alone able to give a few insignificant though precise
	details.

	In a word, after three hours of laborious investigation, after having
	undergone the infliction of all the gossip of the country, after
	receiving evidence the most contradictory, and listened to commentaries
	the most ridiculous, the following is what appeared the most reliable to
	the commissary.

	Twelve years before, at the beginning of 1850, the woman Lerouge had
	made her appearance at Bougival with a large wagon piled with furniture,
	linen, and her personal effects. She had alighted at an inn, declaring
	her intention of settling in the neighbourhood, and had immediately gone
	in quest of a house. Finding this one unoccupied, and thinking it would
	suit her, she had taken it without trying to beat down the terms, at
	a rental of three hundred and twenty francs payable half yearly and in
	advance, but had refused to sign a lease.

	The house taken, she occupied it the same day, and expended about a
	hundred francs on repairs.

	She was a woman about fifty-four or fifty-five years of age, well
	preserved, active, and in the enjoyment of excellent health. No one
	knew her reasons for taking up her abode in a country where she was an
	absolute stranger. She was supposed to have come from Normandy, having
	been frequently seen in the early morning to wear a white cotton cap.
	This night-cap did not prevent her dressing very smartly during the day;
	indeed, she ordinarily wore very handsome dresses, very showy ribbons
	in her caps, and covered herself with jewels like a saint in a chapel.
	Without doubt she had lived on the coast, for ships and the sea recurred
	incessantly in her conversation.

	She did not like speaking of her husband who had, she said, perished
	in a shipwreck. But she had never given the slightest detail. On one
	particular occasion she had remarked, in presence of the milk-woman and
	three other persons, “No woman was ever more miserable than I during my
	married life.” And at another she had said, “All new, all fine! A new
	broom sweeps clean. My defunct husband only loved me for a year!”

	Widow Lerouge passed for rich, or at the least for being very well off
	and she was not a miser. She had lent a woman at La Malmaison sixty
	francs with which to pay her rent, and would not let her return them.
	At another time she had advanced two hundred francs to a fisherman of
	Port-Marly. She was fond of good living, spent a good deal on her food,
	and bought wine by the half cask. She took pleasure in treating her
	acquaintances, and her dinners were excellent. If complimented on her
	easy circumstances, she made no very strong denial. She had frequently
	been heard to say, “I have nothing in the funds, but I have everything I
	want. If I wished for more, I could have it.”

	Beyond this, the slightest allusion to her past life, her country, or
	her family had never escaped her. She was very talkative, but all she
	would say would be to the detriment of her neighbours. She was supposed,
	however, to have seen the world, and to know a great deal. She was very
	distrustful and barricaded herself in her cottage as in a fortress. She
	never went out in the evening, and it was well known that she got tipsy
	regularly at her dinner and went to bed very soon afterwards. Rarely had
	strangers been seen to visit her; four or five times a lady accompanied
	by a young man had called, and upon one occasion two gentlemen, one
	young, the other old and decorated, had come in a magnificent carriage.

	In conclusion, the deceased was held in but little esteem by her
	neighbours. Her remarks were often most offensive and odious in the
	mouth of a woman of her age. She had been heard to give a young girl
	the most detestable counsels. A pork butcher, belonging to Bougival,
	embarrassed in his business, and tempted by her supposed wealth, had at
	one time paid her his addresses. She, however, repelled his advances,
	declaring that to be married once was enough for her. On several
	occasions men had been seen in her house; first of all, a young one, who
	had the appearance of a clerk of the railway company; then another,
	a tall, elderly man, very sunburnt, who was dressed in a blouse, and
	looked very villainous. These men were reported to be her lovers.

	Whilst questioning the witnesses, the commissary wrote down their
	depositions in a more condensed form, and he had got so far, when the
	investigating magistrate arrived, attended by the chief of the detective
	police, and one of his subordinates.

	M. Daburon was a man thirty-eight years of age, and of prepossessing
	appearance; sympathetic notwithstanding his coldness; wearing upon his
	countenance a sweet, and rather sad expression. This settled melancholy
	had remained with him ever since his recovery, two years before, from a
	dreadful malady, which had well-nigh proved fatal.
